# CLI-Mahatati
A Python CLI tool that lets you search live intercity bus departures in Algeria by city zipcode. Powered by the unofficial Mahatati API from SOGRAL, it supports automatic date selection (today + tomorrow), city-to-code mapping, and displays clean, readable trip info including time, bus name, route, license plate, and price.
